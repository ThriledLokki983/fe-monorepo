# React Aria Integration Summary

## What We Accomplished

âœ… **Modified the existing Button component** to use React Aria Components instead of creating a new component
âœ… **Maintained the same API** while enhancing accessibility and interaction states
âœ… **Ensured only the @mono/components package** uses `react-aria-components` as a dependency
âœ… **Updated TypeScript interfaces** to extend React Aria's ButtonProps for better type safety
âœ… **Enhanced SCSS styles** to support React Aria's data attributes (`data-hovered`, `data-pressed`, `data-disabled`, `data-focus-visible`)
âœ… **Centralized dependencies** at the root level while keeping `react-aria-components` specific to the components package
âœ… **Verified build and typecheck** pass successfully

## Key Changes Made

### Button Component (`Button.tsx`)
- Imported `Button as AriaButton` from `react-aria-components`
- Changed the component to use `<AriaButton>` instead of native `<button>`
- Updated prop handling to use `isDisabled` instead of `disabled` (React Aria convention)
- Maintained all existing functionality (icons, loading states, variants, sizes)

### Button Interface (`Button.interface.ts`)
- Extended `ButtonProps` from React Aria instead of `ButtonHTMLAttributes`
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing props
- Added proper TypeScript support for React Aria features

### Button Styles (`Button.module.scss`)
- Added support for React Aria data attributes alongside traditional pseudo-classes
- Enhanced hover states with `&[data-hovered]` selectors
- Enhanced pressed states with `&[data-pressed]` selectors
- Enhanced focus states with `&[data-focus-visible]` selectors
- Enhanced disabled states with `&[data-disabled]` selectors

### Package Dependencies
- `react-aria-components ^1.10.1` is **only** in `@mono/components` package
- All other packages in the monorepo do **not** have access to `react-aria-components`
- Centralized common dependencies (React, TypeScript, Vite, etc.) at the root level

## Benefits Achieved

ðŸ”¹ **Enhanced Accessibility**: Built-in ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
ðŸ”¹ **Better Interactions**: Proper touch handling, focus management, and interaction states
ðŸ”¹ **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript integration with React Aria's type system
ðŸ”¹ **Future-Ready**: Foundation for building more complex accessible components
ðŸ”¹ **Controlled Dependency**: Only the components package uses React Aria, preventing bloat in other packages

## Next Steps

The Button component is now ready for production use with enhanced accessibility. You can:

1. **Build more components** on top of React Aria (Modal, Select, DatePicker, etc.)
2. **Add comprehensive tests** for the Button component's accessibility features
3. **Create documentation** for the React Aria integration patterns
4. **Expand the component library** with other accessible components

The foundation is now properly set up for a scalable, accessible component library! ðŸŽ‰
